Python Wordle

Description
  - I created a Python-programmed version of Wordle. This implementation allows users to guess a 5-letter word with a limited number of attempts, providing feedback on correct letters, misplaced letters, and incorrect letters.

Features
  - Interactive GUI interface using tkinter.
  - Random word selection from a word list file.
  - Feedback system indicating correct, misplaced, and incorrect letters. 
  - Attempt counter and game status updates
  - Input validation for 5-letter words.

Code Overview
  - The code uses 'tkinter' for the GUI, including entry fields, buttons, and labels.
  - A word list is loaded from a file, and a random word is selected as the secret word.
  - The game tracks attempts, updates used letters, and provides feedback after each guess.
  - The game ends when the word is guessed or all attempts are used.
